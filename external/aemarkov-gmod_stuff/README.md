## Killer Bath
Killer Bath is a main and the best of my scripts. Basically, It's just a prop of the bath with E2 chip which is 
flying very fast to the closest player and kill it. The terrable nightmare with no mercy It will finally find you
and kill you. Run, Forest, run!

Core bath features:
 - orientation control with PID-controller
 - position control with PID-controller
 
Modifications:
 - killer bath - fly, hit and kill
 - flying bath - controllable flying bath-based vechicle
