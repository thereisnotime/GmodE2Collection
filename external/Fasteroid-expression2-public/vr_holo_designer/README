README

To use this yourself, extract the contents of EZ-INSTALL.zip into the root expression2 folder (garrysmod/data/expression2/) and merge any folders it requests to merge.
Once completed, spawn vr_holo_designer.txt in the world and refer to the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBw6j0v6cZ0 to get started.

If you want to install without the zip, make sure to pick up a copy of holostructurelib (and stick it in your e2 root directory)

Cheers.
