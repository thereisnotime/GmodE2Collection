README

To use this yourself, extract the contents of EZ-INSTALL.zip into the root expression2 folder (garrysmod/data/expression2/) and merge any folders it requests to merge.
Once completed, spawn gmod_plate_cutter.txt in the world and refer to the list of commands in chat to get started.

Advanced users may now select different databases to use by changing the first include within platebuilderlib.

Cheers.
