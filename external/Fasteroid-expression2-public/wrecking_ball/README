README

To use this yourself, extract the contents of EZ-INSTALL.zip into the root expression2 folder (garrysmod/data/expression2/) and merge any folders it requests to merge.
Once completed, spawn wrecking_ball_main.txt in the world.  If you have concmd enabled (wire_expression2_concmd 1), the E2 will automatically spawn the required wire components.

Cheers.
