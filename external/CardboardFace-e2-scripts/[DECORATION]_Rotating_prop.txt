    This expression makes the prop it's attached to rotate, if the prop has an axis constraint
    
    Some nice props to use (spawn them with "gm_spawn <model>" in console are:
    Ceiling fan: models/props/de_prodigy/fanoff.mdl
    Spinning gears: models/Mechanics/gears/gear12x6.mdl

@name Rotating prop
@persist E:entity
interval(300) #Execute the E2 code every 300ms

if(first() | dupefinished())

    setName("Spinning props

    # Store variable for faster access
    E = entity():isWeldedTo()
    
    # Make ents near-weightless so they lose their speed slower
    # (applyAngForce does nothing on weightless props)
    entity():setMass(1)
    E:setMass(1)
}

E:applyAngForce(ang(vec(0, 30, 0))) #Set the angle force to rotate prop
