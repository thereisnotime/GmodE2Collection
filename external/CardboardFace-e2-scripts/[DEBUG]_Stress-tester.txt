    Used to check server OP limits
    
    To simply test how many OPs max are allowed, set min and max to the
    same value.
    
    To test soft quota and hard quota, use different values.
    
    Soft quota:
        E2 can exceed this quota temporarily, though will abort if
        exceeded for too long
    
    Hard quota:
        The soft quota limit
    
    Tick quota:
        How many OPs the E2 can run per tick, maximum
