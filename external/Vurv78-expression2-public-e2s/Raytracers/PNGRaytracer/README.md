# PNG Raytracer

This is a small raytracer that takes advantage of the png library (https://github.com/Vurv78/expression2-public-e2s/tree/master/E2Libraries/PNGLib) also posted this repo under E2Libraries.

It also takes advantage of the Texture Collector v4 starfallex chip to collect the textures in (rrrgggbbb) uncompressed format, that can be found here https://github.com/Vurv78/starfallex-creations/tree/master/StarfallEx/GMODTextureCollector/Texture-Collector-v4-(Probably-Final)

You don't NEED both of these to work, you could technically just use your own way of acquiring texture pixel data, but these two are the intended and best ways of doing this.

Pls don't try and use anything over 128x textures especially on servers. You will lag yourself to death
