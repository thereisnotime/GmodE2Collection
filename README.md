# GmodE2Collection

Expression2 Collection that includes all of my E2s and some other external E2s that I like - some are random, some are crappy but all of them will make you happy. 

## Structure

- `_local` the local files that will be gitignored

## Usage

Just place the files from the repository in your expression2 folder, example:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/thereisnotime/GmodE2Collection -o C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\expression2
```
